# Hive-Zippelin-HDFS-Analyze-Health-Care-Business

## Information about the data:
The data we have used for the analysis of this project is Accident data(resourced from Kaggle which was taken under the  open license agreement under Statistics Canada).  
Introduction of the Company:- Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency of Canada, responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating statistical information to support evidence-based decision-making. In, regards to accident data, Statistics Canada collects and publishes a wide range of information on motor vehicle collisions through the Canadian Motor Vehicle Traffic Collision Statistics program. 
This program is a collaboration between Statistics Canada, Transport Canada, and the provinces and territories. The data is available on the Statistics Canada website, offering a variety of reports, tables, interactive maps, and charts. The accident data provides a comprehensive view of motor vehicle collisions in Canada and serves as an essential resource for policymakers, researchers, and the general public in understanding and addressing road safety issues.

## Steps:
1. Cleaning and structuring data from draw data.
2. Using HDFS and Hive to post and retrieve data, and using Zippline to visualize data through charts.
3. Minimize data and visualize by using PowerPoint.
   
## Results:
Analysis 1: An analysis of the number of accidents that occurred in a year, along with an examination of the months in which the most and least accidents took place over the years, provides insights into when most accidents are taking place.
